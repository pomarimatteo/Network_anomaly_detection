# Network anomaly detection
###### This repository contains code and report of a lab project as part of *Digital Forensics* course - ICT for Internet and Multimedia, University of Padua, 2022.

---

The goal of this project is to develop an **autoencoder** capable of analyzing the provided network traffic dataset and determining whether the analyzed traffic exhibits malicious or safe behavior. The dataset represents network traffic in a 2D format, with malicious packets being highlighted.  


    
The provided dataset has been extensively studied in the paper titled "[**Analysis of a 2D Representation for CPS Anomaly Detection in a Context-Based Security Framework**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsip.2021.814129/full)".
