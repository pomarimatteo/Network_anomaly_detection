# Network anomaly detection
***
This repository contains the code and report of the laboratory project as part of *Digital Forensics* course at the University of Padova.  

The project revolves around the analysis of a dataset provided, which has been extensively studied in the paper titled [**"Analysis of a 2D Representation for CPS Anomaly Detection in a Context-Based Security Framework."**]((https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsip.2021.814129/full)).  

The paper introduces a 2D representation of network traffic, where malicious packets are highlighted. Building upon this research, our primary objective was to develop an autoencoder capable of analyze
the network traffic matrices derived from the 2D representation. The goal is to determine whether the analyzed traffic exhibits malicious or safe behavior.
